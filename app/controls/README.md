Controls
========

<b>Directory structure:</b> each `Control` that is not `Form` must be descendants of `App\Controls\Control`.
Class name should not be suffixed with `Control` unless there is a name collision. `Forms` should be placed in the `forms`
folder and must be descendants of `App\Controls\Forms\Form`.
